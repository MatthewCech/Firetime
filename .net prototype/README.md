Brief     : Standalone hybrid checklist and time management app.
Platforms : Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10 (anything supporting .net 4.5)

Install Instructions:
	(Note that at this time there is no formal installer, so a few extera steps will have to be taken.)
	1. Extract files. Note that the directory you put the executable file in is where it will save off information about your tasks.
	2. Run the executable. This should work by default on windows 10, but you may be asked to install a .net framework. That's fine and good, if necessary click install then relaunch the app.
	3. I reccomend putting a shortcut on your desktop to access this app. If you want it to start on startup, you can place a shortcut in the windows startup folder, located by default here: C:\Users\[UserName]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup


Usage tips:

	+ This is a standalone task management app that's a hybrid between a checklist and a time estimation tool. The idea is to improve your ability to estimate the amount of time it will take to complete a task, if not just keep track of your tasks for you.
	+ Press the 'add' button to add a new task to the list. You can select the task and use the auto-time button to start a timer, and press the same button again to stop the timer for the selected task. You can also manually complete tasks with a given time, and edit existing ones you have made.
	+ Task lists stored upon app startup and exit- abornmal program termination may result in data loss. Items stored in .cfg file in executable directory. Also know that clearing the tasks on the history page does not clear active tasks. 

NOTE: This is the program's Beta release. At this time, it is largely feature complete. There may be bugs, I am not responsible for you putting an abnormally high amount of faith in my programming. I would be happy to hear about any bugs or feedback by email, listed at the top of this readme.

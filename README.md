# Firetime (ALPHA)
A web-based tool using Firebase, D3, Bootstrap, and FontAwesome to make a simple task tracking and time estimation tool.

To use: 
  - Login with google account (or try the test)
  - Enter a task: Name, Description, Time Estimate, and Label Color
  - Move it to active when you start it
  - Mark it as completed when you're done
  
That's it! From there, you can check out the data visualization tools or history in order to see what tasks you've done.
